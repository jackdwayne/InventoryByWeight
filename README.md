# InventoryByWeight
An application that will return the number of items by dividing the total weight by the wieght of the item.
## Purpose
To solve the issue in my Air National Guard unit where hand jamming every single peice of medical equipment was taking to many man hours. With limited hours as duty status guardsmen, this can help get the task get done faster and allow the unit to be more productive during regular scheduled drills.
## Design
<1.0.0> 
The user will open the application and be met with two input boxes. The first will be for the total weight and the second will be for the individual item. A button named "calculate" will take the input of the two input boxes and run the dividing function and return the number of items.
## Application Requirements
<1.0.0> 
A functioning native mobile application that is downloadable and able to use without the internet. Must provide very accurate calculations so as to provide quality information that introduces less error than counting hundreds of items by hand.
A How-To page will be provide instruction on how to properly use the application to introduce less error. This will inlude instructions on taring the scale when an item such as box introduces extra weight that could throw off the return value.
## Outside Requirement
<1.0.0>
The application will be used in conjuction with a scale.
## Scalability
The application could be scaled up to have a database and login to access and save inventory and item information. This would allow items to be remembered by id tag such as a serial number and also store the individual item weights. Furthermore, the previouse amount could be saved and after a mission or drill weekend the application could provide how many of a certain item was used. The logistician would then know exactly how many items to order.
A barcode system could make the process faster by being to scan the item then interacting with the database.
